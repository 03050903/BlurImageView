# BlurImageView
BlurImageView For Android, you can load your image progressively like [Medium](https://medium.com/@wing_jay/thinking-about-the-way-of-loading-picture-by-medium-4adfe792b437).

###How it works?
1. First it will show user a blurry image;
2. At the same time, it starts to load the real image;
3. once loaded, replace the blurry one automatically.

###Why I do this?
This lib is inspired by [Medium](https://medium.com/@wing_jay/thinking-about-the-way-of-loading-picture-by-medium-4adfe792b437) and users love this way of loading pics, Because a beautiful Blurry pic is always better than a blank area or an ugly thumbnail.
